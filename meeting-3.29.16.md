# Plan of Action
- picking initial direction and going with it - solidify constants
- build upon this years code
- plus of unified development environment (e.g. Project Writer OSX)

#Meeting Logistics
- setting a precedent for dedicated people 
- more frequently meeting, less time per session 
- idea of “self teaching” and pairing people in groups 

#Relocation of meeting space
- Reserve large lecture hall central campus, first couple of meetings 
- No true necessity to meet down in the current lab
- Make classroom reservations again central campus (e.g. Savery)
- Some appeal for “off the dock” demo, but land robot may be sufficient for classroom

#Philosophy of Recruitment
##Open to all
- large investment of creating a coding related training plan
- larger training basis, idea of TAs walking through problems
- maybe implementing training tracks

##Limited 
- qualifications: programming since beginning of high school
- doesn’t require creation of training materials
- expectation for preliminary meetings IDE setup, hello world
